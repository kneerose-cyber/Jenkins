Developer have a website and if he needs to test a code and check the webpage, the best bet is to setup a webhook and any commit he makes in lower environment, it will  

why webhook - When an event occurs in one system (e.g., a new code commit, a new issue created, or a payment received), the webhook sends an HTTP POST request to a specified URL, allowing the receiving system to take immediate action.
Example : When a developer commits a code in github to test any changes or issues on a website, webhook can trigger that code and deploy in a server and developer can see the change right away, Mostly use cases are in lower environment like QA, UAT etc

webhook
    Source Code Management
     git repo  (mater branch)
    build triggers
     git hook trigger polling

    github (settings)
     webhook (post request to below url)
     payload url -http://jenkinsips:8080/github-webhook/
     after selecting trigger event with above web hook
     make change in the github repo, it should trigger build in jenkins


Github(code)  -> docker (build & test)  -> hub (push to docker hub/ push image ) -> ec2 instance (deploy on server )
