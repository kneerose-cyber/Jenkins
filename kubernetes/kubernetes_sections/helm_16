Creating a Helm chart in Kubernetes involves creating a directory structure, defining configuration files, and packaging them into a Helm chart. 
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes applications, and it allows you to define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes applications.
it's like yum repo, package manage


myapp/ 
   charts.yaml, readme, templates/, values.yaml, charts/, requirements.yaml

helm create myapp
helm package myapp
helm install .\myapp\ --name myapp-chart
helm ls
helm status myapp-chart
helm delete myapp-chart
